# Generalized Rock-Paper-Scissors
This project implements a command-line game with a focus on secure gameplay and flexibility. The core game mechanics can be customized, allowing for variations on classic themes (e.g., Rock-Paper-Scissors with additional moves).

## **Key Features**

### User-Defined Rules: 
Players can specify the rules of the game, including the possible moves and their relationships (which beats which).
### Cryptographic Integrity: 
The project utilizes HMACs (Hash-based Message Authentication Codes) to guarantee fair play and ensure moves cannot be predicted or manipulated.
### Help System: 
A built-in help system clearly explains the rules of the current game.
